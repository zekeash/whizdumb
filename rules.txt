Whizdumb is based on the board game Wits and Wagers, which leverages
the wisdom of crowds to find answers to numeric questions.  The wisdom
of crowds sounds smart but can miss badly, hence, wisdom = whizdumb.

After every player has given a name to sign in, the first numeric
trivia question appears. 

Every trivia question in whizdumb has a numeric answer. (Remember to
type only numeric answers -- without commas, units, symbols, etc. You may
use decimals.)

You may have no idea of the correct answer, but that does not matter
at all. Guess any number.  After all of the guesses are in, you will
see what all of the players have guessed, but you still will not learn
the correct answer.  Instead, the betting phase begins.

In the betting phase, you can place up to two bets on the answers that
you and the other players have given. You start with two tokens. You
can bet these tokens on the answer that you gave, the answer that
another player gave, or on the option that every answer given is
greater than the true answer. Betting on the right answer will give you more points,  which you can use to make your bets more valuable in later rounds.
If you have less than 2 points at the end of each round, your point total will be returned to 2, so there is no need to worry about being eliminated.

After all bets are in, the correct answer is revealed. The winning bet is
the value that is *closest without being greater* than the correct
answer.  For example, if the correct answer is 300, and players have
guessed 293 and 301, then 293 would win (301 is greater than the true
answer).

Who wins? Everyone who bet on the winning answer, which may or may not
include the contestant who gave the winning answer in the first
place. The point is not to know things; it is to bet on who knows
things.

whizdumb works if you know a lot of trivia.  whizdumb also works if
you have good intuition about the knowledge of others. have fun.
